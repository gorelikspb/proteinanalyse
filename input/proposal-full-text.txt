Background
Protein expression 
at Trenzyme harnesses a variety of expression systems in 
mammalian
, insect, yeast, and bacterial
 cell cultures
.
The typical process starts with a given amino acid sequence. This sequence is analyzed by experienced scientists 
at Trenzyme 
for important features like 
for example 
the presence of signaling peptides
, transmembrane domains, or protease cleavage sites using bioinformatics tools. The results of this analysis feeds into the choice of the expression system and the design of the expression construct. T
arget protein
s
 that 
might be
difficult
be 
expressed
 can be identified and
the expression system optimized
leveraging the
 deep understanding of key features of 
the
 biological system
s
 and creative approach to maximize yield and activity. 
In addition, 
TrenzymeÆs
 high-throughput protein expression optimization 
method
can be applied for an efficient combinatorial testing
 of different expression strains/cell lines and culture conditions such as growth media and additives, temperatures, induction conditions, extraction methods and other parameters
.
Identifying the optimal expression conditions for s
uccessful expression 
of active protein 
in sufficient quantity
is challenging to predict and d
epends on
 a large variety of factors including
 characteristics of the protein sequence, of the expression system and of the expression construct. 
Trenzyme and 
Stemick
 believe that a systematic analysis of available protein expression data
 in combination with expert knowledge using modern machine learning tools provides a promising opportunity to support and streamline 
TrenzymeÆs
 workflow and ultimately achieve higher success rates for target protein expression.
